Boostrap grid on the frontend.
I used only functional components for the sake of todays trends in react.
Although class components are still valid way to write a react component,
whole community is moving to functional comps and since facebook introuduced
useState in 16.8 ver of react you can write statefull functionals thus allowing us
to create whole project without using classes + code looks cleaner + improved performance


Tests:
I used Jest for unit testing. I only tested in/out data. Usually, I don't test UI with jest because
I don't really see the point... maybe with more sophisticated UI it would be helpful but for something
like that, I only test UI in terms of visual performance, responsivity and cross-browser esthetics on different
devices.
